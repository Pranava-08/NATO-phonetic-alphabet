 tells you the NATO phonetic alphabets for a word

The NATO phonetic alphabet, also known as the International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet or the ICAO phonetic alphabet, is a set of standardized phonetic pronunciations used to spell out letters and digits over radio or telephone communications where clarity is essential. It was developed by NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) in the 1950s to facilitate communication between speakers of different languages and to avoid misunderstandings caused by similar-sounding letters or numbers.
